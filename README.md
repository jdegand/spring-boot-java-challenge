# Spring Boot Java Challenge

This is my solution to the [Ada School's Spring Boot Java Challenge](https://github.com/ada-school/spring-boot-java-challenge).

## Directions

### Coding Challenge 

A bus company wants to start using technology and allow their users to book online tickets. Please help them build a [REST API Level 2](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html#level2) (preferrable) that lets them control their trip bookings, supporting the following operations:
* Create a new booking with the following information: name, email, origin, destination, departure date and time and duration.
* Update an existing booking
* Find a booking using its ID.
* Delete an existing booking.

#### Expected Quality Attributes:
* Using coding best practices.
* SOLID principles.
* Clear usage of Dependency injection.
* Correct usage of Spring Boot annotations.
* Correct connection with a persistance layer.

#### Desired technology stack:
* Java / Kotlin 
* Spring Boot
* MongoDB

## Thoughts

- Debatable if you should just use one collection object versus splitting the object into more documents
- You would first signup and create an account.  After that, you would be able to purchase a ticket.  
- One to many relationship?  A person can buy multiple tickets. 
- Make ticket an embedded document inside person document?  
- Embedded documents create data duplication, which increases storage requirements.  However, embedded documents make querying for data easier.  
- This [article](https://spring.io/blog/2021/11/29/spring-data-mongodb-relation-modelling) gives an overview on how to use `DBRefs` and `@DocumentReference` to replace embedded documents. 
- I decided to take an approach similar to the article.  
- Added basic CORS config versus having to annotate methods or controllers.
- Debatable if adding `final` to parameters is really necessary. It doesn't really hurt, and it helps make you more deliberate about what you are doing in the code.

## Continued Development

- Could add Thymeleaf for a frontend.  
- Testing 
- CommandLineRunner to seed database
- `Duration` is problematic inside entities.  Need to investigate more.  Might need to use `@Transient` and store the duration in the database as a string.
